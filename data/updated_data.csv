That is why i prefer split pushing if I am selected as a top laner. As a mid laner, I only trust myself and so I have generally only picked characters that scale and are strong late so I always have a future and I can always believe in my own strength. I am not toxic though. I won't flame though I will bm the opponent using an emote here and there if i remember for mental warfare because this game is a mental game and being honorable is a joke.
